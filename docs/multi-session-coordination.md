# Multi-session coordination — cross-session signal

When two or more Claude Code sessions are working in the same repo at the same
time, they can produce overlapping or wasted work without ever colliding at the
git level. This doc names the failure modes, explains why the cheap ones are
caught and the costly ones aren't, and lists the signals that would actually
shrink the costly category.

## The two outcomes of shared-surface contention

When two sessions touch the same surface, their work ends up in one of two
buckets. Only one of them is currently caught.

### Duplicate work (cheap — git catches it)

Two sessions independently write the same fix.

- Git detects identical patches at merge/push time.
- "Already up-to-date" or merge conflict surfaces the collision.
- Worst case: a `chore(cleanup)` commit lands twice on the same branch under
  the same name (e.g. `#65`/`#73` both titled `fix(nav): … remove unused
  GroupMode`, same branch, identical 1806-byte diff, 9h apart). Even then the
  damage is bounded — wasted review cycles, no broken behavior.

In practice this is rare in this repo. When the historical search turned up
near-duplicate commits, most were rebase-replay artifacts: the same logical
commit (same `author_date`, different `commit_date` and parent) lands on `main`
twice via two merge resolutions. That isn't duplicate authorship; it's the
same patch counted twice.

### Orphaned work (expensive — nothing catches it)

Session A polishes a surface; Session B replaces or removes that surface
upstream without knowing. A's work lands, builds clean, ships, and dies within
the hour.

The canonical example (2026-06-08 / 09 evening):

```
23:20  #305 lands — polishes sessions-view.tsx (+286 lines incl. tests)
23:58  ced714c    — ChatSurface drops the SessionsView fallback
00:30  14466de    — sessions-view.tsx, .css, polish test all deleted (-2132)
```

PR #305 lived for ~70 minutes. The polish ideas may have informed the
ChatList direction, but the actual code is gone from `main`. The author of the
deletion knew — they explicitly named "the chat-polish test that targeted only
SessionsView internals" as something to drop, meaning they were aware they
were reverting just-merged work.

Both sessions did locally-valid work. Neither did the other's work. The waste
isn't redundancy; it's misallocation.

## Why duplicate is caught but orphaned isn't

Duplicate work lives in the *codebase*. Two diffs against the same lines
collide at commit/push time, and git refuses to silently lose data.

Orphaned work lives in *intent*. "Session B is about to delete this surface"
exists only in Session B's running context — never in the file tree, never in
the index, never in `git status`. Session A's diff against the soon-to-be-
dead file passes typecheck, passes the suite, builds clean, and ships. There
is no point in the standard developer loop where the fact of impending
removal becomes visible.

This means orphaned-work prevention can't be retrofitted via git or CI alone.
The signal has to live somewhere both sessions check before committing to a
direction.

## Signals that would actually help

Listed cheapest first.

### 1. Surface-claim file — `.claude/claims.json` ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Status:** Built as an automatic PreToolUse hook —
`scripts/surface-claim-guard.mjs`, wired in `.claude/settings.json` (matcher
`Edit|Write|NotebookEdit`). It removes the "nothing forces sessions to write
claims" fragility below: claims are now a *byproduct* of editing, requiring zero
discipline.

On every Edit/Write to the **shared primary checkout**, the hook:
- records this session's claim on the target file (keyed by `session_id`);
- prunes claims with no activity in the last ~2h;
- if another live session already claimed that exact file, surfaces a collision
  warning to both the user (`systemMessage`) and the model
  (`hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`).

It is **advisory only** — it never blocks or fails an edit (always exits 0, even
on corrupt input). Edits inside `.worktrees/` are skipped: those sessions are
already isolated, and their divergence surfaces at PR/merge time (see §2). The
warning fires for the *second* session to touch a file — exactly the moment a
clobber would otherwise happen silently. Covered by
`scripts/surface-claim-guard.test.mjs`.

---

A flat file recording "Session X has begun work touching surfaces Y and Z."
Updated when a session starts a non-trivial task on a surface; cleared on
session exit or when the task lands.

```jsonc
{
  "ttys029": {
    "started": "2026-06-08T23:24Z",
    "surfaces": ["src/components/inbox-escalations-view.tsx"],
    "intent": "feat: severity rails + filter chips + bulk actions"
  },
  "ttys044": {
    "started": "2026-06-08T23:55Z",
    "surfaces": ["src/components/chat-surface.tsx", "src/components/sessions-view.tsx"],
    "intent": "refactor: dedupe to single chat list, then delete SessionsView"
  }
}
```

Before starting work on a surface, a session greps claims for collisions.
Before committing, a session re-checks for surface overlap and surfaces the
collision to the user.

Fragile because: nothing forces sessions to write claims, claims go stale, and
the file becomes another source of merge conflict if checked in. Mitigations:
keep it gitignored (so it doesn't conflict), expire entries older than ~2
hours, and treat the absence of a claim as "no claim made" rather than "no
work in progress."

This is the cheapest first move and the most likely to actually get adopted.

### 2. Worktree-per-session as default, not exception

CLAUDE.md already documents the worktree convention. The orphaned-work case
above happened on the *primary checkout* with 5+ sessions sharing it. If each
session had its own `.worktrees/<branch>` from the start, they'd still have
been writing to the same `main` eventually — but the divergence would have
surfaced at the merge/PR moment, not at the silent deletion moment.

Worktrees don't prevent orphaning; they make it visible earlier. A `gh pr
create` for a worktree's branch surfaces the diff against current `main`
*before* merging, which is the first moment another session's deletion would
show up as a conflict or a stale-context warning.

### 3. Intent-tagged commits with sentinel-style assertions

The `sidebar-minimal.test.ts` update in PR #298 is a good pattern: when
removing a surface, leave a *negative-import sentinel* test that asserts the
file isn't reintroduced. Future sessions running the suite see the assertion
break the moment they recreate the surface — even if they don't read commit
history. This works *after* the orphaning has happened but at least prevents
re-orphaning the same surface twice.

Companion to this: when adding a new surface that's likely to be touched by
parallel sessions (large component, IA-load-bearing), drop a positive-import
sentinel in the same test that says "X must still be the consumer of Y" so
that someone removing Y notices Y has a known consumer.

### 4. Pre-commit broadcast (expensive, rarely justified)

A pre-commit hook that pings a shared file/socket announcing "session X is
about to commit Y" and waits N seconds for objections. Catches the most
adversarial cases but adds latency to every commit and forces network/IPC
plumbing. Mention here for completeness; don't build it unless the cheaper
options have demonstrably failed.

### 5. Destructive-op guard — `scripts/worktree-guard.mjs` ✅ IMPLEMENTED

Duplicate and orphaned work are the *slow* failure modes. The fast one is
**destroyed** work: on 2026-07-03 an actor found another session's in-progress
worktree, pushed its (unpushed) commit, merged it as PR #2290, and ran the
standard post-merge cleanup — `git worktree remove` + `git branch -D` — while
the owning session was mid-edit. Every uncommitted change was lost. The same
gutted-worktree "husk" pattern (only a `.next/` or `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`
recreated by a process still running inside) had already hit two other
worktrees on prior days. A sibling incident (#2286) chained
`git push origin --delete` after a merge that had actually *failed*, which
auto-closed the still-open PR.

The guard is a PreToolUse hook on **Bash** (wired next to the surface-claim
guard in `.claude/settings.json`) and — unlike the claim guard — it **blocks**
(exit 2), because these ops destroy unrecoverable state:

- `git worktree remove <path>` / `rm -rf .worktrees/<name>` (the worktree
  *root*; deeper paths are the owner's business) is blocked when the worktree
  is **dirty** or its HEAD exists on **no remote ref**. Husks (no `.git` link)
  and clean+pushed worktrees pass silently, so normal post-merge cleanup and
  husk GC stay frictionless. `rm -rf .worktrees` (the whole container) checks
  every child.
- `git branch -D <name>` is blocked when the branch tip is contained in no
  remote-tracking ref (deletion would orphan unpushed commits).
- `git push <remote> --delete <branch>` (or `push <remote> :<branch>`) is
  blocked while an **open PR** still has that head branch. Needs `gh`; fails
  open offline.

Deliberate destruction: prefix the command with `WT_GUARD_BYPASS=1 ` — the
guard only ensures it can't happen *by accident*. The corollary discipline for
sessions: **push your branch to origin after every commit.** The remote is the
only store a local actor can't destroy, and an unpushed commit is both bait
for premature merges and the only recoverable artifact afterward.

Known hole: the guard only covers actors that run through Claude Code hooks.
The 2026-07-03 actor left no session transcript (likely a familiar/automation
running outside the hook system) — for those, the pushed-branch discipline and
the branch-protection rules are the only backstops.

**Audit log (cave-boor8).** On 2026-07-29 `.worktrees/probe-timing` was
destroyed holding 3 uncommitted files, and the post-mortem could not tell a
deliberate `WT_GUARD_BYPASS=1` from a hole in the guard — the bypass path left
no trace. The guard now appends one JSON line per **bypass** and per **block**
to `.claude/worktree-guard-bypass.log` (gitignored): `at`, `verdict`,
`session`, `cwd`, `command`, and for blocks the `reason`. Read it as evidence,
in three tiers: a `bypass` entry names a deliberate override; a `block` entry
followed by the worktree's disappearance names an actor that retried *outside*
the hook; and **no entry at all** means the destruction never routed through
the Bash tool — an external terminal, editor, or automation, which no
PreToolUse hook can see. That last tier is the one the pushed-branch
discipline exists for.

**Audits record paths, not counts (cave-boor8's other lesson).** probe-timing
was unrecoverable *even in principle* because the sweep that flagged it logged
only `dirty=3` — once the directory was gone there was no filename or content
signature to match `git fsck` debris against. Any sweep or audit that touches
a dirty worktree must capture the full `git status --porcelain` output (paths,
not counts) in its notes or bead. Three lines of porcelain is the difference
between "recovery impossible" and a targeted `lost-found` search — and for
UNSTAGED edits (which never enter the object store) it is the only record that
the work existed at all.

## The PR layer: duplicate publication of the same work

Every guard above assumes the collision happens locally — worktree-guard
blocks destruction, surface-claim-guard warns on co-edited files, and the
sections above cover duplicate and orphaned *work*. A fourth failure mode
happens entirely on GitHub, where none of them can see (observed 2026-07-29,
cave-pimgr):

1. Session A commits on `feat/grant-audit-console` and pushes.
2. Nine minutes later a different actor opens a PR on that same branch —
   same commit, same title — and merges it. The repo's auto-delete setting
   removes the head branch.
3. Session A's own `gh pr create` now fails with
   `No commits between main and feat/grant-audit-console`.

Nothing was destroyed and no file was co-edited, so no hook fired. The cost
came from *misreading the aftermath*: session A interpreted the (correct)
`gh` error as branch corruption, "recovered" a branch that needed no recovery,
and opened a duplicate PR; a second session doing unrelated GC found the
branch gone and independently wrote "another session deleted work" into its
summary — which session A then treated as corroboration. Two agents inferring
destruction from identical ambiguous evidence is not confirmation. Net: a
false destructive-actor incident report, a duplicate PR, and an hour of
investigation. Across the preceding 200 PRs, four head refs carried more
than one PR — rare, not unique.

Two habits kill this failure mode outright:

- **Before `gh pr create`, check whether the branch already has one:**
  `gh pr list --state all --head <branch>`. If a PR exists — open or merged —
  report it instead of creating a second. One command ends duplicate
  publication entirely.
- **Treat `No commits between main and <branch>` as a SIGNAL, not an
  error.** It usually means the work is already ON main. Before concluding
  anything was lost, verify in two steps:
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor <your-sha> origin/main` answers yes for
  merge/fast-forward landings, but a SQUASH merge — this repo's default —
  rewrites the sha, so on "no" continue with
  `git cherry origin/main <your-sha>` (a leading `-` means a
  patch-equivalent commit is already upstream) and
  `gh pr list --state merged --head <branch>` (a merged PR on the branch IS
  the landing record, whatever the merge style). Any one of the three
  answering "landed" means the branch deletion was routine post-merge
  cleanup. That check would have ended the 2026-07-29 incident in seconds.

The corollary for the *reading* side: a vanished branch plus a merged PR
containing your commit is the signature of **completed publication**, not
destruction. Check the PR history for the branch before writing
"another session deleted my work" into any summary — the next session will
believe you.

A heavier option — a branch-claim mechanism mirroring surface-claim-guard so
a session can see another owns a pushed branch — remains unbuilt; the two
habits above have so far been sufficient.

## Practical recommendations for sessions

Until any of the above is built, sessions should:

1. **Check live sessions before non-trivial work.** `ps -ef | grep ' claude --'`
   plus `lsof -p <pid> | awk '$4=="cwd"'` shows who's where. Five sessions in
   one cwd is the smell.

2. **Diagnose before risky git operations.** Already in CLAUDE.md, but worth
   re-emphasising: rebases, cherry-picks, and `reset --hard` on a shared
   checkout race with concurrent work. The 2026-06-08 incident where another
   session's `reset --hard` wiped uncommitted edits is the canonical example.

3. **When polishing a surface, briefly check `git log -p` on its consumers.**
   If the consumer's recent history shows it's being decoupled from your
   surface, your polish may be about to be orphaned. A 30-second check, not a
   full audit.

4. **Surface intent to the user when starting structural work.** "I'm about to
   delete SessionsView" is the kind of statement that, if surfaced to the
   user, gives them a chance to say "wait, another session is polishing
   that." The user is the only entity with cross-session visibility today.

5. **Prefer worktrees for any task that involves more than three file edits**
   or any structural change. The worktree itself is a cheap signal —
   `git worktree list` is one of the only places where "Session B is working
   on branch C" is visible to Session A.

6. **Check the PR layer before publishing and before crying destruction.**
   `gh pr list --state all --head <branch>` before `gh pr create`; and on
   `No commits between main and <branch>`, verify the work landed
   (`merge-base --is-ancestor`, then `git cherry` for squash merges, then
   `gh pr list --state merged --head`) before concluding anything was lost.
   See "The PR layer" section above for the incident that made both habits
   policy.

## Open questions

- Is `.claude/claims.json` worth prototyping, or does worktree-as-default
  cover enough of the gap?
- Does any of this generalise beyond Claude Code? The same failure mode
  could exist for human pair-programming sessions sharing one checkout, but
  humans usually have a Slack channel.
- The user is currently the cross-session bridge by hand ("session A is
  doing X, session B is doing Y"). Does any of this make their job easier
  or just relocate the bookkeeping?

## Source

Patterns observed via `git log` on `origin/main` over the 2026-05-30 →
2026-06-09 window. The orphaning case (PR #305 → `14466de`) is reconstructable
from commits alone; the duplicate-work false positives required diffing
`author_date` vs `commit_date` on near-duplicate subjects. No prior cross-
session coordination doc existed in this repo when this was written.
