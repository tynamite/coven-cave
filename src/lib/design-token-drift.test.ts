// Design-token drift gate — Cave UX P3 (Sage's 2026-07-03 audit).
//
// The design-language shipping checklist (docs/coven-design-language.md §9,
// rule 1) is "tokens only — no hardcoded colors, radii, or font sizes". This
// gate keeps that contract enforceable in two tiers:
//
//   1. ZERO TOLERANCE for on-scale literals: running the codemod
//      (scripts/codemods/tokenize-css.mjs) over every in-scope CSS file must
//      be a no-op. A `font-size: 12px` that should be `var(--text-sm)` fails
//      here — fix by running:  node scripts/codemods/tokenize-css.mjs
//
//   2. RATCHETS for the judgment categories (off-scale px values, hex colors
//      outside token definitions, inline TSX style objects). These can only
//      go DOWN. If you add one deliberately (e.g. a genuinely dynamic inline
//      style), lower-or-equal is enforced — raise the baseline in the same
//      PR and say why. When you reduce drift, lower the baseline to bank it.
//
// The codemod's px→token tables are pinned against the live definitions in
// src/app/globals.css, so a token retune fails loudly instead of letting the
// codemod silently rewrite to stale values.
//
// RUN THIS FILE WITHOUT THE CSS FACADE HOOK. This gate measures the PHYSICAL
// CSS tree, so scripts/run-tests.mjs deliberately runs it without
// `--require ./scripts/css-source-contract-hook.cjs` (RAW_SOURCE_SCANNER_TESTS).
// Under the hook — the incantation every OTHER source-contract test wants —
// fs.readFileSync inlines import facades and every imported sheet is counted
// twice, inflating the ratchets ~1.6x into convincing but bogus "went UP"
// failures. The guard below fails fast instead (cave-d1a0p).

// and every number this gate would produce is wrong.

  offScaleFontSizePx: 146, // -5: banked — the GitHub card composer ("Final Card Components.dc.html" handoff, cave-076kh) ships fully on the type scale, and rebasing onto current main reclaimed the rest. +1: chat session redesign (Chat.dc.html 2a) — the assistant turn's serif familiar name keeps the design's 18px step, between --text-lg 16px and --text-xl 20px; every other size in the new session-chrome sheet is on the type scale (the new-session hero uses a clamp off the display size). 10.5px/11.5px/… — need per-case renormalization to the type scale (banked: canvas-editor.css on the type scale; familiar-tab retokenized the old hero/section styles; research-desk tabs shipped fully on the type scale, -3; familiar-tab five-section rebuild shipped fully on the type scale, -1; projects access page rebuild shipped fully on the type scale, -2). +1: Research Reader (Research Reader.dc.html handoff) — the EB Garamond findings hero <h1> keeps the design's 31px display size (between --text-display 28px and the next step); every other reader font-size uses the type scale and compact mono labels use the `font:` shorthand. -3: orphaned skill-browser removal reclaimed its off-scale sizes. -2: Phone control-sheet extraction replaced the legacy block with section-local tokenized CSS.
  offScaleSpacingPx: 1707, // +22: Weaves & Proposals redesign ("Weaves and Proposals.dc.html" handoff, cave-f8rdi) — the new surface-weaves.css keeps the mock's decision-surface density off the 4px grid: 6px icon-to-label gaps across crumbs, ghost buttons, tallies, verdict lines, strand heads and thread identifiers (8px separates the glyph from its word); 2px segmented-control track insets and the trace/lineage line gaps; 3px crumb insets that keep the back-arrow optically aligned with the crumb text. Every 5px micro-gap and pill inset was snapped to --space-1 in this PR instead (8 of them), every larger step is on the space scale, tokenize-css.mjs is a no-op over the file, all font-sizes are on the type scale, and the sheet carries zero hex. +12: chat session redesign (Chat.dc.html 2a/2b) — the session-chrome sheet keeps the mock's compact rhythm off the 4px grid (5px chip/stat gaps, 2px stat padding, 10px hero margin, the user card's 11px/15px padding), and the rail + new-chat launcher headers add 7px/10px label gaps with 5px count-pill insets. off-4px-grid pad/margin/gap components — banked: canvas-editor.css on the space scale (-1) + familiar-tab snapped to the 4px grid (-5). +123: research-desk redesign (cave-dl74) — the five tab sheets keep the design's compact even 2px-offset rhythm (6/10/14/18/22px gaps and paddings, same family the surface it replaced used); odd values were snapped to the grid in the same PR. +7: home-minimal PR (2026-07-22) — new home-composer/landing-composer.css + hearth-continuations.css compact UI rhythms (7px gaps, 6px accent-dot, 5px pill gap, 13px/14px organic pill padding — off-scale by design for visual compactness). -10: projects access page rebuild (cave-luq4) replaced the hub CSS fully on the space scale; re-banked at 1467 after rebasing onto main commits 7cf9d13f0..fbcadfd3b which added +4 (still -6 vs the pre-rebuild 1473). -1: drive-by banked in the hex-token chunk PR (cave-gyh2). +26: Queue tab redesign (Queue.dc.html handoff) — the refreshed familiar-work-queue.css keeps the design's compact rhythm (7px control gaps, 6px row-meta gaps, 5px check-dot gaps, 3px accent rail, 30px action-button height, 130px note-textarea min-height, 180px forward-menu min-width, 37px menu offset); on-scale values were tokenized by tokenize-css.mjs in the same PR and font-size literals were snapped to the type scale. -2: Tasks toolbar redesign (tasks-list-redesign-refresh) swapped the compact board header for the design's roomier command bar; net off-scale spacing dropped even though the new toolbar adds off-scale rhythm, because the removed compact-header + search-wrap block carried more off-grid values. +40: launcher 3a home dashboard (home-dashboard.css) — the work-led dashboard shell keeps the design mock's compact rhythm (13/22px chrome & board padding, 9/10/11/18/26px rail & row gaps/padding, 2/3/5/6/7px micro-gaps incl. the Resume CTA pill), off the 4px grid by design; the redesign also RECLAIMED the retired hearth/hero/Continue sheets, so this is the NET delta after removal; on-grid values were tokenized by the codemod in the same PR. +20: Review Deck redesign (Review Deck.dc.html handoff) — new review-deck.css keeps the design's compact rhythm (2px stat/pill micro-gaps, 3px pill padding, 5px pill gaps, 6px row/eyebrow margins, 7px key/button gaps, 14px panel-head padding), off the 4px grid by design; the trivially-equivalent 9/7/13px values were snapped to the space scale in the same PR and font-size literals to the type scale. +34: Familiar Analytics modernization (cave-q8uc, Familiar Analytics.dc.html handoff) — the refreshed familiar-analytics surface (surface-reporting.css) keeps the design mock's compact rhythm: 14px heal/contract-detail card padding, 10px attention/heal gaps, 11/13px collapse & button paddings, 7/9px heal-card button padding, 5/6px micro-gaps, 2/3px chip nudges — off the 4px grid by design for the dense card/chip/modal layout; on-scale values were tokenized by tokenize-css.mjs in the same PR. +3: Marketplace "Explore" redesign (Marketplace.dc.html handoff) — the merged Explore rail + toolbar keep the mock's compact rhythm (1px rail-row gap, 2px view-toggle inner padding, 10px rail-label inline padding); on-scale values were tokenized by tokenize-css.mjs in the same PR. -10: hearth-home restore / dashboard-to-new-chat — the hearth sheets' +7 compact rhythm returned, but relocating the dashboard into the chat empty state retired its chrome/dock/project-button blocks (13/22px chrome + 14/22px dock padding, 9/10/11px project paddings), a net reclaim. -12: new-chat dashboard simplification (cave-gxap) — the context rail retired (18px rail padding/gap, 9/10/11px project/quick/pick paddings & gaps, 2px micro-margin) and the board's 26px padding/gap snapped to the space scale; the rail-less board is a capped no-scroll column. +11: Research Reader (Research Reader.dc.html handoff) — the reader chrome keeps the design's compact reading rhythm off the 4px grid (34px page inset & doc top padding, 48px reading-column gutter, 22/14px contents-rail padding, 7px toc/link paddings, 15px lede indent, 20px list indent, 18px rail padding, and 5/6/7/9/10/11px micro paddings & gaps across the toolbar, source cards, and focus overlay); trivially on-grid values were tokenized by tokenize-css.mjs in the same PR. -39: orphaned skill-browser removal (cave-vewe follow-up) — deleting the retired surface's ~609-line .skill-browser__* block reclaimed its compact off-grid rhythm wholesale. -16: Phone control-sheet extraction replaced the legacy block with section-local tokenized CSS after rebasing onto current main. +87: daily report redesign ("Daily Report - Redesign.dc.html" handoff, variant 2a) — the chaptered-day surface keeps the mock's compact rhythm off the 4px grid: 2/3/5/6/7px micro-gaps across the week strip, stat band, streak pips, spine dots and cast rows; 9/10/11px control and card paddings; 14px band/cast/rail gaps; 18px chrome and panel-host insets; and the spine's structural 78px/62px gutters that pair with the negative `left` offsets of its time column and dots (changing one without the other desyncs the rail). All on-grid values were tokenized by tokenize-css.mjs in the same PR, and every font-size was snapped to the type/icon scales (net 0 on offScaleFontSizePx). Two of the four new sheets — daily-report-shipped.css and daily-report-modals.css — carry ZERO off-grid spacing, so this is the irreducible remainder from the shell and the carousel. +6: Canvas page redesign (Canvas.dc.html handoff) — the gallery and sketch editor keep the mock's segmented-control rhythm off the 4px grid: 3px track padding + 2px rider gaps on the kind filter and on the editor's mode/viewport groups, 2px padding + 1px gap on the inspector's weight segments, and the 18px card-field gap that pairs with the 226px thumbnail (dropping to 16px crowds the cards, 20px loses a column at common pane widths). Same compact-segment family the Marketplace Explore and Review Deck handoffs banked; the two trivially-equivalent values (a 2px popover-row gap and a 3px action-row inset) were snapped to the space scale in this PR instead, and every font-size snapped to the type scale (net 0 on offScaleFontSizePx). +16: Projects access refresh (Projects.dc.html handoff) — the ledger, view switcher, bulk band, card grid, rows table and by-level tree keep the mock's chip density off the 4px grid: 5px micro-gaps (ledger key, mix chips, grant chips, pill gaps), 7px ledger and mix-chip column gaps, 6px tree-chip, card-name and card-foot gaps, 3px card id gap, 2px view-switcher inset, and the 1px hairline rails. Every larger step was snapped to the space scale in this PR (the mock's 9/10/11/13/14px paddings and gaps became --space-2/-3/-4), which is why this is 16 and not the 41 the sheet started at; tokenize-css.mjs is a no-op over the file. +1: the Rituals inbox daily-report row — the 24-bar merge-by-hour sparkline needs a 1px hairline gap between bars; a 4px grid gap would erase the chart. Every other value in that sheet is on the space scale. +50: GitHub card composer ("Final Card Components.dc.html" handoff, cave-076kh) — the new gh-card-composer.css keeps the mock's cockpit density off the 4px grid: 10px header/status/sheet gaps and paddings, 9px section-body and margin rhythm, 7px slot and gate-row gaps, 5px palette-label and chip paddings, 11px pill/tab/merged insets, 6px commit-box padding, 3px tool and segment insets, 2px segment-track and meta nudges, the 1px toolbar gap, and the structural 29px section-body indent that aligns expanded rows under the section title (it pairs with the 11px caret + 13px glyph + gap ahead of it, so changing one without the others desyncs the accordion). Every plain single-value gap that sat 1px off a token was snapped to --space-1/--space-2 in this PR instead (14 of them), font-sizes are 100% on the type scale, and the sheet carries zero hex. -6: Research Studio media controls moved their new option fields and progress presentation fully onto the spacing scale.
  offScaleRadiusPx: 230, // +6: chat session redesign (Chat.dc.html 2a/2b) — the context row's 6px mono chip and 4px stat cell, the group headers' 4px count pills and the rail row's 2px state tick: short compact marks between --radius-control 8px and square. Every container corner uses --radius-card/--radius-panel/--radius-pill. 4px/6px/10px/14px/… radii between the sanctioned steps. +5: research-desk 2px/4px accent-mark radii (short solid marks, not container corners). -5: projects access page rebuild removed the hub's off-step radii. +1: Research Reader accent-mark radius (the section-heading 2px tick, same short-solid-mark family as the research desk). -3: orphaned skill-browser removal reclaimed its off-step radii. -3: Phone control-sheet extraction replaced the legacy block with section-local tokenized CSS. +8: daily report redesign (2a handoff) — the chaptered-day surface's 1/2/3/4px radii on short solid marks (week-strip activity bars, streak pips, swimlane segments and merge ticks, the spine's accent rail), the same short-mark family the research-desk and Research Reader handoffs banked; every container corner snapped to --radius-control/-card/-panel/-sm in the same PR. -2: Canvas page redesign (Canvas.dc.html handoff) — the gallery card's 10px corner and the inspector swatch's `50%` circle snapped to --radius-card and --radius-pill. +3: Projects access refresh — the 5px radius on the card select-checkbox (17px) and the two 18px icon buttons (disclose, gear); --radius-control (8px) reads as a circle at those sizes. Every container corner in the new sheet uses --radius-control/-card/-pill. +1: the Rituals inbox daily-report row's 24-bar merge sparkline, same short-solid-mark family (a 3px-wide bar cannot take a scale radius). +8: GitHub card composer (cave-076kh) — the composer's 4px chips (reactions, assignee/label chips, gate-row actions, scope chips, toolbar buttons) and 3px segment thumbs (Write/Preview, merge method, verb mode), the same short-compact-mark family the research-desk, Research Reader, daily-report and Projects handoffs banked; --radius-control (8px) reads as a pill at a 19-22px chip height. Every control corner uses --radius-sm (the design's own "5-6px control" band) and every container --radius-control/--radius-pill.
  hexOutsideDefinitions: 0, // hex in render CSS (token definitions excluded) — -104: cave-gyh2 chunk 1 (dropped stale var(--token, #hex) fallbacks; mapped accent/danger/success fills to their semantic foregrounds; promoted --color-success-foreground and the codex --cv-* strays). -1 banked in the design-doc reconcile PR (cave-kf3x). -51: cave-yxiz chunk 2 zeroed the ratchet — document grounds (sketch/preview/thumb/QR) now share the fixed --surface-paper token in foundations.css; GitHub state badges promote --gh-merged/--gh-merged-ink and pair open/closed with the semantic status foregrounds; profile-card strays joined the --pfc-* palette; the magic-cast spell art promotes --spell-violet/--spell-core; QR ink, dashboard mark ink, and the avatar photo-overlay ink became local definitions; and pure shade/alpha arithmetic in color-mix()/mask gradients uses the CSS black/white keywords (sanctioned: they're mix anchors, not colors — matching the pre-existing keyword usage in dashboard.css and surface-compact-calendar.css). New hexes belong in token definitions; keywords are only for mix/mask arithmetic.
  inlineTsxStyles: 190, // +8: thread instruments (cave-j86la) — every one is a measured or model-computed value, not presentation: the spine's per-node `top` and line height come from live turn-offset measurement, its stack height/segment heights are proportional to the turn's tool counts, and the minimap's pane height, caret `top`, per-event bar width/height and the shared hover card's row-anchored `top` are pane-measure + model-derived. +2: the context row's context-window meter paints a computed percentage width — a genuinely dynamic value, not presentation. style={{…}} in TSX; many are legit dynamic values (banked from 500 — the count had drifted far below the old ceiling; -2: projects access page rebuild dropped the hub's inline styles; +1: vendored Blaze.tsx canvas host uses dynamic style spread for WebGL positioning; +1: vendored Peel.tsx canvas host for page-peel reveal effect uses runtime-mutated inline styles; +2: project-setup modal color swatches paint runtime-only values (per-root tint + oklch palette choice); -1: orphaned skill-browser removal dropped its inline style; -45: Phone extraction moved static presentation out of settings-shell.tsx; -1 net: the daily report redesign retired daily-report-ui.tsx and shipped-table.tsx, and its own new inline styles are dynamic-only — CSS custom properties carrying computed percentages and the model's semantic tone; -1 more when the shipped rows' external links became in-app buttons opening the app's GitHub card; -3 net against the declared baseline after rebasing: one concurrent reduction banked, and two GitHub task-status dots moved from token-valued inline styles to state classes)
